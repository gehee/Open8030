/* Automatic TX power, the pure part. The decision is the power model
 * (AR_PWR_AUTO_CLEAN_DBM, below); the rules described next are its history,
 * and only the overload step-down is still one of them.
 *
 * Automatic TX power: A receiver judges how it hears its
 * peer and asks the peer for its TX power (stock's pwr_auto2 messages);
 * nobody moves its own power from its own measurement. Each received frame
 * of the peer's is one record: whether it was errored, its SNR (the
 * receiver's raw scale: linear, 36 = 0 dB) and the AGC gains of both paths
 * (a code: higher is a weaker signal).
 *
 * Ours, not stock's step-by-step votes (a walk took 4 s from 13 to 26 dBm):
 * TX power and SNR are both dB and move together, so the climb is the
 * shortfall. The SNR, filtered (s + 3 snr) / 4, in dB:
 *  - under target_db10 with the weaker path's gain at weak_gain or more (a
 *    weak signal - more power raises its SNR; with a strong one the SNR is
 *    the receiver's, ~21-24 dB close by, and more power only overloads it):
 *    ask for the power now + the shortfall, rounded up, in one request
 *    (up_records apart: the next measurement has to see it);
 *  - errored records: `burst` in a row asks for the maximum, `window` in
 *    the last 16 for +3 dB;
 *  - over target + band_db10 (and nothing above): 1 dB down once it has held
 *    down_ms, down_records apart;
 *  - the weaker path's gain at or under overload_gain is a signal too
 *    strong for the receiver: never up then, and with the SNR under the
 *    target too (overloaded: its SNR falls with more power, 17-18 dB at 27
 *    dBm a metre away) 1 dB down after overload_ms. A low gain with a good
 *    SNR is only a strong link: it holds in the band, descends over it.
 * The gain is the weaker path's, filtered over ~16 records (g + (new - g) /
 * 16): one record's swings (26-34 at 26 dBm close by) crossed overload_gain
 * every few records, each restarted the overload hold, and the power sat at
 * the maximum, overloaded, for good (walk, 2026-10-26).
 * Always inside [min, max]. */

 * the ceiling's; every power in the range is then predicted, and the best
 * is asked for (ties to the lower; a move only for 1 dB or more). Up on
 * the fast SNR once it has said so for up_records records in a row (a fade),
 * at most up_step dB a request (a deep fade climbs again up_records later),

 * from up_hold_ms after the last up, at most down_step dB a request (drive
 * 2026-10-29 on a buggy: without the hold every fade went 22 -> 26 and the
 * model walked it back 26 -> 24 -> 22 within ~10 s, 13 times in 4 minutes,
 * and 24 <-> 26 every few seconds far out). The receiver overloaded (gain at its floor
 * with the SNR short) still steps down on its own, before the model.
 * Measured on a Lite+ (single TX antenna) 15-30 m off, receiver not
 * overloaded (gain 59-75): the SNR peaked at 20-23 dBm and was 2 dB lower at
 * 26; fitted ceiling ~24 dB to 22 dBm, ~1 dB less per dB above (flight
 * 2026-10-29: 19.5 dB at 26 dBm, 23 at 22, at the same received level).
